BitSet :
1. Find first set bit
2. Rightmost different bit
3. Count total set bits -> Use their apperaing pattern
4. Find MAX AND -> Set rightmost bit and and then check
5. Odd number from array (XOR) -> XOR all values
6. Two different odd number (XOR) -> Separate based on last bit
7. PowerSet Question -> iter through 0 to 2^n
